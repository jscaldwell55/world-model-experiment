## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings (Non-Critical)

### 1. Token Tracking in Episode Logs
**Issue:** Integration test showed `total_tokens: N/A` in episode validation

**Details:**
- Episode executed successfully with all other fields present
- Token usage tracked during execution (confirmed via LLM interface)
- Possible issue: Aggregation or serialization of token counts to episode log

**Impact:** Low - tokens are tracked at LLM level, may just be missing from final log

**Recommendation:** Monitor token tracking in pilot. If issue persists, tokens can be reconstructed from LLM usage stats in provenance logs.

**Status:** Non-blocking for pilot execution

### 2. Tools Warning for HotPot
**Issue:** "Warning: No tools found for HotPot" when initializing Model-Based agent

**Details:**
- Model-Based agent still initializes and runs successfully
- May indicate tools are optional or environment-specific

**Impact:** Minimal - agents function correctly without explicit tool definitions

**Status:** Non-blocking

## Pilot Execution Estimates

### Scale
- **Episodes**: 40 (2 environments √ó 4 agents √ó 5 seeds)
- **Workers**: 6 parallel

### Time Estimate
- **Per episode**: ~30-120 seconds (based on integration test + complexity)
- **Sequential**: ~40-80 minutes
- **Parallel (6 workers)**: ~15-20 minutes

### Cost Estimate
- **Model**: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
- **Judge**: gpt-4-0125-preview (only when programmatic judge insufficient)
- **Per episode**: ~1000-3000 tokens (ACE optimized)
- **Total tokens**: ~40,000-120,000 tokens
- **Estimated cost**: $15-25 (per config_ace_pilot.yaml)

---

## Monitoring Recommendations

### During Pilot Execution

1. **Check token tracking**: Verify tokens are logged in first few episodes
2. **Monitor judge usage**: Track what % of episodes need LLM judge (target: <20%)
3. **Watch for failures**: Any episode failures should be <5% of total
4. **Verify outputs**: Spot-check first episode from each agent-env pair

### Post-Pilot

1. **Run analysis immediately**: `python analyze_ace_pilot.py results/ace_pilot`
2. **Generate Pareto plot**: Verify ACE positioning on frontier
3. **Check for anomalies**: Any episodes with zero tokens, failed evaluations, etc.

# Agent test (with MockLLM)
python3 -c "from agents.ace import ACEAgent; from agents.base import MockLLM; agent = ACEAgent(llm=MockLLM(), action_budget=10); print('‚úÖ ACE initializes')"

# Judge test
python3 -c "from evaluation.judge import ProgrammaticJudge; j = ProgrammaticJudge(); r = j.judge('test', 'test'); print(f'‚úÖ Judge works: {r.correct}')"

# API test

```

### Full Integration Test

```bash
# Run 1 test episode (uses test seed 999)

```

### Reproduce Script Validation

```bash
# Check syntax (doesn't execute)
bash -n reproduce.sh && echo "‚úÖ Syntax valid"

./reproduce.sh

# 3. Analyze results
python analyze_ace_pilot.py results/ace_pilot
