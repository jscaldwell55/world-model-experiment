# Memory Validation Test - 3 Episodes per Environment
# Purpose: Validate that SimpleWorldModel learns across episodes
#
# Expected behavior:
# - Episode 1: Default priors (prior_strength=0.1, confidence=0.1)
# - Episode 2: Loads beliefs from Episode 1 (confidence=0.12)
# - Episode 3: Loads consolidated beliefs (confidence=0.14)
# - Performance should improve as agent learns
