# World Model Experiment Results Summary

**Preregistered Study Comparing ACE vs. Belief-State Agents**

## Overview

This study compared three agent architectures on world modeling tasks:
- **ACE** (Agentic Context Engineering): Context-based learning with playbooks
- **ACTOR**: Explicit probabilistic belief state updates
- **OBSERVER**: Observational baseline (no active exploration)

**Study completed:** October 31, 2025
**Preregistration:** Locked at commit `cd41f0c` before data collection
**Total episodes:** 506 successful (603 attempted, 83.9% completion rate)

## Key Results

### Overall Performance

| Agent | Accuracy | Avg Score | Tokens/Episode | Cost/Episode |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **ACTOR** | **81.2%** | 8.12/10 | 19,289 | $0.12 |
| **ACE** | 70.3% | 7.03/10 | 20,692 | $0.13 |
| **OBSERVER** | 69.4% | 6.94/10 | 6,381 | $0.04 |

### Critical Finding: ACE Struggles with Quantitative Questions

Performance breakdown by question type (ChemTile environment):

| Question Type | ACE | ACTOR | Gap |
|---------------|-----|-------|-----|
| **Planning (easy)** | 12.3% | 100.0% | **+87.7%** |
| **Counterfactual (medium)** | 18.5% | 100.0% | **+81.5%** |
| Planning (medium) | 53.8% | 91.8% | +37.9% |
| Interventional (medium) | 82.3% | 97.8% | +15.5% |
| Interventional (easy) | 87.7% | 94.0% | +6.3% |
| Interventional (hard) | 93.1% | 88.1% | -5.0% |

## Root Cause Analysis

**ACE maintains qualitative knowledge** (textual playbook items):
```
"For compound D synthesis: keep at medium temp → mix A+B→C →
 cool to low temp → mix C+B→D"
```

**ACTOR maintains quantitative beliefs** (explicit probabilities):
```python
{
  'A+B': {'C': 0.8, 'explode': 0.1, 'nothing': 0.1},
  'C+B': {'D': 0.7, 'explode': 0.2, 'nothing': 0.1}
}
```

### Example Failure Cases

**Q:** "What's the probability of successfully creating C from A and B at medium temp?"
- **ACE:** "Unable to determine" (0.2 confidence) ❌
- **ACTOR:** "0.788 (approximately 78.8%)" (0.75 confidence) ✅

**Q:** "Can we produce D without any risk of explosion?"
- **ACE:** "Unable to determine - insufficient information" (0.2 confidence) ❌
- **ACTOR:** "No, we cannot produce D without any risk of explosion" (0.9 confidence) ✅

## Interpretation

This is **not a bug in ACE**, but a **fundamental architectural limitation**:
- ACE's qualitative context evolution excels at strategic reasoning
- ACE struggles with precise probability estimation questions
- ACTOR's explicit belief state is perfectly aligned with quantitative queries

## Scientific Contribution

This study identifies **boundary conditions** for context engineering approaches:
- **Strength:** Qualitative strategy accumulation
- **Weakness:** Quantitative probability reasoning
- **Implication:** Suggests need for hybrid architectures combining both approaches

## Experimental Rigor

- ✅ **Preregistered design** (hypothesis, methods, analysis plan)
- ✅ **Locked code version** (Git SHA: cd41f0c)
- ✅ **Controlled comparison** (same seeds across agents)
- ✅ **Large sample** (506 episodes, 5,060 questions)
- ✅ **Multiple environments** (ChemTile, HotPotLab, SwitchLight)
