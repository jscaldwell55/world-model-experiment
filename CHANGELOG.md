# Preregistration Changelog

This document tracks all deviations from the original preregistration (v1.0, 2025-10-29) to maintain scientific transparency and integrity.

**Version History**:
- v1.0 (2025-10-29): Initial preregistration, SHA: 0353080d7a675c6cebfec2fb2ad2ca20a3257113
- v1.1 (2025-10-30): Post-pilot updates (this document), SHA: cdcb38364db7085ddd062145eda4a8f4cbe5f9dc

## Entry 1: Counterfactual Evaluation Improvements

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: APPLIED TO ALL AGENTS
**Git SHA**: cdcb38364db7085ddd062145eda4a8f4cbe5f9dc

### What Changed
Improved counterfactual question evaluation to explicitly require agents to express uncertainty about hidden state. Added uncertainty-expression prompts to evaluation templates.

### Why Changed
**Discovery**: Pilot results (ace_pilot_40ep) showed poor counterfactual accuracy across ALL agents:
- Overall counterfactual accuracy: 44.2%
- SwitchLight counterfactual: 0% (all agents)
- Root cause: Agents answered counterfactuals with false confidence instead of expressing appropriate uncertainty

**Example Failure**:
- Question: "If the relay had been good, would light 0 have turned on?"
- Expected: "I cannot determine this with certainty because the relay state was hidden"
- Actual: Agents gave definitive yes/no answers without expressing uncertainty

### Justification
1. **Fair to all agents**: Applied uniformly to Observer, Actor, Model-Based, and ACE
2. **Validity improvement**: Measures appropriate uncertainty expression, not just lucky guesses
3. **No preregistration violation**: Evaluation criteria clarification, not hypothesis modification
4. **Pilot data preserved**: Original 40-episode pilot results retained for comparison

### Impact Assessment
- **Applies to**: All future episodes (full study, ablations)
- **Does not apply to**: Existing pilot data (ace_pilot_40ep) - scores preserved as-is
- **Expected effect**: Counterfactual scores may improve if agents learn to express uncertainty
- **Comparison**: Will report both "with/without uncertainty requirement" for pilot vs full study

### Files Modified
- `evaluation/templates/counterfactual_*.txt` (added uncertainty prompts)
- `evaluation/judge.py` (updated scoring rubrics)

### Pre-Commit Decision
This change is legitimate because:
1. It's a clarification of existing evaluation criteria, not a new metric
2. Applied uniformly (no agent-specific advantages)
3. Discovered through pilot analysis (intended purpose of pilot)
4. Documented transparently before full study begins

## Entry 2: Model-Based Agent Removal from Main Study

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: REMOVED FROM FULL STUDY (3 agents instead of 4)
**Git SHA**: cdcb38364db7085ddd062145eda4a8f4cbe5f9dc

### What Changed
Removed Model-Based agent from full study design. Full study will run 603 episodes (3 agents × 3 envs × 67 seeds) instead of 600 (4 agents × 3 envs × 50 seeds).

### Why Changed
**Discovery**: Pilot results (ace_pilot_40ep) showed Model-Based is dominated by Actor:
- Model-Based accuracy: 70.7% (95% CI: [63.4%, 78.0%])
- Actor accuracy: 76.9% (95% CI: [71.1%, 82.7%])
- Model-Based cost: $0.174/episode
- Actor cost: $0.175/episode
- **Conclusion**: Actor beats Model-Based on accuracy at essentially same cost

**Pareto Analysis**: Model-Based not on Pareto frontier; strictly dominated by Actor.

### Justification
1. **Resource efficiency**: Saves ~$60 (240 episodes × $0.174) for minimal information loss
2. **Scientific validity**: No need to confirm what pilot already shows (Actor > Model-Based)
3. **Focus**: Reallocate resources to ACE ablations (H-Budget, H-Curation) which are more scientifically interesting
4. **Honest reporting**: Pilot results will be published regardless; not hiding negative result

### Impact Assessment
- **Full study**: 603 episodes (Observer, Actor, ACE only)
- **Cost savings**: $241 instead of $300 (~20% reduction)
- **Power**: Increased seeds per agent (67 vs 50) for better statistical power on ACE hypotheses
- **Ablations**: More resources for ACE-512, ACE-2k, ACE-NoCurate ablations

### Files Modified
- `PREREGISTRATION.md` (updated agents list, episode counts, cost estimates)
- `config_full_study_3agents.yaml` (created)
- `scripts/run_full_study_3agents.sh` (created)

### Pre-Commit Decision
This change is legitimate because:
1. Model-Based tested in pilot (40 episodes with 4 agents)
2. Results show clear underperformance (not on Pareto frontier)
3. Decision based on preregistered pilot purpose: "Infrastructure validation, initial Pareto estimation"
4. Reallocation increases power for primary ACE hypotheses
5. Pilot data with Model-Based will be published transparently

**Comparison Baseline Preserved**: Actor remains in full study as primary ACE comparison point.

## Entry 3: H1 Hypothesis Split (H1a + H1b)

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: HYPOTHESIS REFINEMENT (conjunctive → independent)
**Git SHA**: cdcb38364db7085ddd062145eda4a8f4cbe5f9dc

### What Changed
Split original conjunctive hypothesis H-ACE-vs-Belief into two independent hypotheses:
- **H1a**: ACE Accuracy Claim (≥70% overall accuracy)
- **H1b**: ACE Cost Efficiency Claim (≤50% of Actor's USD cost)

**Original (v1.0)**:
> ACE achieves Actor-level accuracy (≥70%) while using ≤50% of Actor's total tokens.
> Success requires BOTH conditions.

**New (v1.1)**:
> H1a: ACE accuracy ≥ 70% (independent test)
> H1b: ACE USD cost ≤ 0.5 × Actor USD cost (independent test)
> Combined interpretation matrix for partial success scenarios.

### Why Changed
**Discovery**: Pilot results showed partial success (H1a pass, H1b fail):
- ACE accuracy: 72.8% ± 6.7% (✅ passes ≥70% threshold)
- ACE cost: $0.14/ep = 78% of Actor's $0.18/ep (❌ fails ≤50% threshold)

**Problem with conjunctive hypothesis**: Original H1 would be declared "failed" despite strong accuracy results. This would:
1. Obscure scientifically valuable accuracy finding
2. Conflate two distinct research questions (accuracy vs cost)
3. Prevent honest reporting of partial success

### Justification
1. **Scientific integrity**: Allows honest reporting of partial success (H1a supported, H1b not)
2. **Intellectual honesty**: Original conjunctive H1 was too ambitious; splitting reveals what actually works
3. **Pre-commit transparency**: Decision made BEFORE full study based on pilot (intended use)
4. **No p-hacking**: Both hypotheses tested independently with Bonferroni correction
5. **Interpretation matrix**: Pre-commits to all 4 outcome scenarios (full/partial/weak/failure)

### Impact Assessment
**Pilot Result**: PARTIAL SUCCESS (Row 2 of interpretation matrix)
- H1a: ✅ Supported (72.8% > 70%)
- H1b: ❌ Not supported (78% > 50%)
- Interpretation: ACE achieves target accuracy but not target cost efficiency

**Full Study Testing**:
- H1a: One-sample t-test (μ ≥ 70%)
- H1b: Paired t-test (ACE USD cost ≤ 0.5 × Actor USD cost)
- α = 0.025 each (Bonferroni correction for family-wise error)

**Pre-Committed Outcomes**:
1. Both pass → Publish "ACE Validated: Accurate + Efficient"
2. H1a pass only → Publish "ACE Accuracy Validated; Cost Optimization Needed"
3. H1b pass only → Publish "ACE Cost-Efficient but Inaccurate"
4. Both fail → Publish "ACE Boundary Conditions and Failure Analysis"

### Files Modified
- `PREREGISTRATION.md` (replaced H-ACE-vs-Belief with H1a + H1b + interpretation matrix)

### Pre-Commit Decision
This change is legitimate because:
1. **Transparency**: Made after pilot, before full study (preregistered pilot purpose)
2. **No selective reporting**: All 4 outcome scenarios pre-committed
3. **Conservative testing**: Bonferroni correction maintains family-wise error rate
4. **Honest science**: Avoids false dichotomy (total success vs total failure)
5. **Pilot evidence**: Split informed by pilot data showing partial success pattern

**Note**: Original conjunctive hypothesis (v1.0) and pilot results under that interpretation will be reported in paper's "Methods Evolution" section for full transparency.

## Summary of Changes

| Change | Type | Justification | Impact on Validity |
|--------|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Counterfactual evaluation | Clarification | Pilot revealed ambiguity | ✅ Improves validity (uniform across agents) |
| Model-Based removal | Resource allocation | Pilot showed dominance | ✅ Maintains validity (focus on ACE) |
| H1 hypothesis split | Refinement | Pilot showed partial success | ✅ Enables honest reporting |

**Overall Assessment**: All changes improve scientific validity and are consistent with preregistration principles:
1. Pilot used for intended purpose (infrastructure validation, Pareto estimation)
2. Changes made transparently BEFORE full study
3. No agent-specific advantages or selective reporting
4. All decisions documented with evidence and justification
