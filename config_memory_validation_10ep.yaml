# Memory Validation Test - 10 Episodes per Environment
# Purpose: Validate that new belief format enables cross-episode learning
#
# Expected behavior:
# - Episodes 1-3: Building initial beliefs (confidence ~0.5-0.6)
# - Episodes 4-7: Strengthening beliefs (confidence ~0.7-0.8)
# - Episodes 8-10: High confidence (confidence ~0.85+)
# - Performance should improve as confidence increases
