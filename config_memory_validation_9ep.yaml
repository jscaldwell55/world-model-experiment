# Memory Validation Test - 3 Episodes per Environment (9 total)
# Purpose: Quick validation that new belief format enables cross-episode learning
#
# Expected behavior per domain:
# - Episode 1: No prior, default confidence (0.5), establishes baseline
# - Episode 2: Loads Episode 1 beliefs, confidence ~0.6-0.7, performance should improve
# - Episode 3: Loads consolidated beliefs, confidence ~0.75+, performance should improve further
