# config_ace_pilot_v2.yaml
# FIXED pilot experiment configuration for ACE agent comparison
#
# FIX APPLIED: Renamed 'ace' -> 'a_c_e' to match agent type conversion
#              ACEAgent class name converts to 'a_c_e' via PascalCase->snake_case regex
#
# Tests ACE (Agentic Context Engineering) against baselines:
# - Observer: No interaction, just reasoning
# - Actor: Interactive with belief updates
# - Model-Based: Actor + explicit transition model
# - ACE: Interactive with context evolution (playbook)
#
# Hypothesis: ACE can match Actor performance at lower token cost
