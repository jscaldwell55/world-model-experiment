# Configuration for collecting 30 HotPot episodes for fidelity validation experiments
#
# Goal: Collect enough data to run all three critical experiments:
# - Experiment A: 20 train + 10 test episodes
# - Experiment B: 3+ HIGH reliability episodes for cross-validation
# - Experiment C: Mix of reliability levels for wrong model detection
#
# Strategy: Run 30 episodes to ensure statistical power
