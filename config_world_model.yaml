# Simple World Model Configuration
# Minimal Viable World Model - evolved from ACTOR with persistent beliefs
#
# KEY IMPROVEMENTS OVER ACTOR:
# - Beliefs persist across episodes (accumulate knowledge)
# - Statistical tracking for noise filtering (fixes HotPot)
# - Causal belief learning (action-outcome relationships)
# - Confidence-based exploration
#
# TARGET: Beat ACTOR's 82.3% baseline while maintaining simplicity
