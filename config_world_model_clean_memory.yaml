# Simple World Model Configuration - Clean Memory Test
# Testing with fresh memory and default prior strength of 0.1
#
# KEY FEATURES:
# - Clean start with cleared memory directories
# - Default prior_strength: 0.1 (balanced adaptability)
# - Persistent beliefs enabled for cross-episode learning
# - Statistical tracking for noise filtering
# - Causal belief learning
#
# OBJECTIVE: Validate simple world model performance with clean slate

# Memory handling (manually verified before run):
# - Cleaned memory/domains directories (0 files confirmed)
# - Fresh start with no prior beliefs loaded
# - Persistence enabled to save new learnings after each episode
# - Default prior_strength: 0.1 maintained throughout
# - Storage location: memory/domains/{hot_pot,switch_light,chem_tile}/
#
# Future enhancement - add this section to config for automated handling:
# memory:
#   clean_start: true              # Clear memories before run
#   storage_path: "memory/domains/"
#   persistence:
#     enabled: true                # Save beliefs after each episode
#     save_after_episode: true     # Write to disk after completion
#     load_at_start: false         # Start fresh for this validation
