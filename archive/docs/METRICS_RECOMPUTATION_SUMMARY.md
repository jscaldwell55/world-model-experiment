# Metrics Recomputation from Raw Logs - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete rebuild of all metrics from raw episode logs, with comprehensive unit testing and verification of data integrity.

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Recomputation Module (`evaluation/recompute_metrics.py`)

A comprehensive module that rebuilds **all metrics from raw JSON logs only** - no cached tensors, no pre-aggregated CSVs.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Loads only raw episode JSON files
- ✅ Recomputes accuracy as `mean(correct)` over same denominator for all agents
- ✅ Recomputes surprisal in **nats** (natural logarithm base e)
- ✅ Fits surprisal slopes using **OLS regression** with proper diagnostics
- ✅ Computes p-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes (Cohen's d)
- ✅ Performs statistical comparisons (ANOVA, t-tests)

**Core Functions:**

```python
from evaluation.recompute_metrics import (
    compute_episode_metrics,        # Compute metrics for single episode
    aggregate_episode_metrics,       # Aggregate across episodes
    compare_agents_statistical,      # Statistical comparisons
    fit_surprisal_slope_ols,        # OLS regression for slopes
    compute_cohens_d                 # Effect size computation
)
```

### 2. Comprehensive Unit Tests (`tests/test_recompute_metrics.py`)

**24 unit tests** verifying correctness of all metric computations:

#### Accuracy Tests (5 tests)
- ✅ Accuracy equals mean(correct) over all queries
- ✅ Same denominator used for all agent types
- ✅ Handles partial scores (not just 0/1)
- ✅ Stratified accuracy by query type
- ✅ Empty results handling

#### Surprisal Tests (4 tests)
- ✅ Units are **nats** (base e, not bits)
- ✅ Formula: `surprisal = -log p(o_t | belief_{t-1})`
- ✅ Filters zero values from non-computing agents
- ✅ Statistics (mean, std, min, max) computed correctly

#### OLS Regression Tests (7 tests)
- ✅ Perfect linear fit verification
- ✅ Negative slope = learning detection
- ✅ Zero slope = no learning detection
- ✅ Correct time indexing
- ✅ P-value computation
- ✅ Insufficient data handling
- ✅ Residual diagnostics

#### Effect Size Tests (3 tests)
- ✅ Cohen's d for large effects
- ✅ Zero effect detection
- ✅ Correct sign

#### Integration Tests (2 tests)
- ✅ Full episode computation pipeline
- ✅ Multi-episode aggregation

**Test Results:** ✅ **24/24 PASSED**

### 3. Data Leakage Verification (`tests/test_data_leakage.py`)

**3 comprehensive tests** verifying no ground truth leakage:

- ✅ **Model-based episodes**: No ground truth in observations during execution
- ✅ **All agent types**: No leakage across 40 episodes in pilot H1H5
- ✅ **Code inspection**: `model_based.py` doesn't access ground truth

**Key Findings:**
1. Ground truth only exists at episode-level metadata (not accessible during execution)
2. Observations contain only measurable fields (e.g., `measured_temp`, `stove_light`)
3. Model-based agent learns from `(observation, action, next_observation)` tuples only
4. No forbidden fields (`actual_temp`, `stove_power`, `heating_rate`) in observations

**Test Results:** ✅ **3/3 PASSED**

### 4. Demonstration Script (`scripts/rebuild_metrics_from_raw.py`)

A complete pipeline that:
1. Loads raw JSON logs from a directory
2. Recomputes all metrics from scratch
3. Performs statistical comparisons
4. Generates comprehensive report
5. Saves results to JSON

**Usage:**
```bash
PYTHONPATH=/Users/jaycaldwell/world-model-experiment \
python scripts/rebuild_metrics_from_raw.py \
  --results-dir results/pilot_h1h5/raw \
  --output results/recomputed_metrics.json
```

## Verification Summary

### ✅ Accuracy Verification

**Verified that:**
- Accuracy = `mean(correct)` over **same denominator** for all agents
- Handles binary scores (0/1) and continuous scores (0.0-1.0)
- Computes stratified accuracy by query type (interventional, counterfactual, planning)

**Example from pilot H1H5:**
```
HotPotLab - actor:        0.880 ± 0.000  (5 episodes)
HotPotLab - model_based:  0.770 ± 0.042  (5 episodes)
HotPotLab - observer:     0.770 ± 0.042  (5 episodes)
```

### ✅ Surprisal Verification

**Verified that:**
- Units: **nats** (natural logarithm, base e)
- Formula: `surprisal_t = -log p(o_t | belief_{t-1})`
- Conversion: 1 nat ≈ 1.443 bits
- Zero surprisals filtered (from agents that don't compute it)

**Example:**
- If p = 0.5, surprisal = -log(0.5) ≈ 0.693 nats
- If p = 0.1, surprisal = -log(0.1) ≈ 2.303 nats

### ✅ OLS Regression for Slopes

**Model:** `surprisal_t = β₀ + β₁·t + ε_t`

**Verified that:**
- β₁ < 0: Learning (decreasing surprisal)
- β₁ ≈ 0: No learning (flat surprisal)
- β₁ > 0: Increasing surprisal (unusual)

**Statistical diagnostics computed:**
- Slope estimate (β₁)
- Standard error
- P-value (test H₀: β₁ = 0)
- R² (goodness of fit)
- Residuals

**Example from pilot H1H5:**
```
HotPotLab - actor:        slope = +0.077 ± 0.224, p = 0.485 (not significant)
HotPotLab - model_based:  slope = -0.039 ± 0.419, p = 0.846 (not significant)
HotPotLab - observer:     slope =  0.000 ± 0.000, p = nan  (no surprisal computed)
```

### ✅ Effect Sizes and Statistical Tests

**Computed:**
- **Cohen's d** for pairwise comparisons
  - |d| < 0.2: small effect
  - 0.2 ≤ |d| < 0.8: medium effect
  - |d| ≥ 0.8: large effect

- **ANOVA F-test** for overall group differences
- **Pairwise t-tests** with Bonferroni correction

**Example from pilot H1H5 (HotPotLab):**
```
ANOVA: F=14.051, p=0.0001 ** Significant overall difference **

Pairwise:
  actor vs model_based:  Δ=+0.110, d=+3.72, p=0.0004 ** (large effect)
  actor vs observer:     Δ=+0.110, d=+3.72, p=0.0004 **
  actor vs text_reader:  Δ=+0.160, d=+4.13, p=0.0002 **
```

### ✅ No Data Leakage Confirmed

**Verified across 40 episodes:**
1. Ground truth never in `observation` during execution
2. Model-based agent uses only `(obs, action, next_obs)` from memory
3. No access to `actual_temp`, `stove_power`, or `heating_rate` at test time
4. Ground truth only in episode metadata (for evaluation post-hoc)

## Key Results from Pilot H1H5
