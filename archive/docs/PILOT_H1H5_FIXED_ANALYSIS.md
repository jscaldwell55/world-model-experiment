| Model-Based  | SwitchLight| 15,266 | 8,592  | 23,858 | 31        | 259.4        |
| Observer     | HotPotLab  | 1,619  | 5,049  | 6,668  | 10        | 131.7        |
| Observer     | SwitchLight| 1,631  | 4,815  | 6,446  | 10        | 128.3        |
| Text-Reader  | HotPotLab  | 1,619  | 4,675  | 6,294  | 10        | 127.5        |
| Text-Reader  | SwitchLight| 1,631  | 4,701  | 6,332  | 10        | 127.7        |

**Critical Findings:**

1. **Massive efficiency gap**: Observer/Text-Reader use **~70% fewer total tokens** than Actor/Model-Based
   - Observer/Text-Reader: ~6,300-6,700 tokens/episode
   - Actor/Model-Based: ~20,500-23,900 tokens/episode

2. **API call difference**:
   - Active agents (Actor/Model-Based): 21-31 calls (10 actions + test questions)
   - Passive agents (Observer/Text-Reader): 10 calls (test questions only)

3. **Time efficiency**: Passive agents complete in ~50% of the time

4. **Performance vs. Efficiency Trade-off**:
   - Actor: +12.7% performance for +267% token cost
   - Model-Based: +9.6% performance for +270% token cost
   - **Efficiency ratio (score/token)**: Observer/Text-Reader are ~2.5-3x more token-efficient

## 4. Belief State Analysis (SwitchLight)

### Actor Agent Belief Convergence

| Episode | Ground Truth | Faulty Relay | Final Belief (Correct Layout) | Correct? |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| ep001   | layout_A     | Yes          | 0.02                          | ❌       |
| ep002   | layout_B     | No           | 0.05                          | ❌       |
| ep003   | layout_A     | No           | 1.00                          | ✅       |
| ep004   | layout_A     | No           | 0.01                          | ❌       |
| ep005   | layout_B     | No           | 0.99                          | ✅       |

**Success Rate: 40% (2/5)**

### Model-Based Agent Belief Convergence

| Episode | Ground Truth | Faulty Relay | Final Belief (Correct Layout) | Correct? |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| ep001   | layout_A     | Yes          | 0.01                          | ❌       |
| ep002   | layout_B     | No           | 1.00                          | ✅       |
| ep003   | layout_A     | No           | 0.99                          | ✅       |
| ep004   | layout_A     | No           | 0.00                          | ❌       |
| ep005   | layout_B     | No           | 0.99                          | ✅       |

**Success Rate: 60% (3/5)**

### Critical Issues Identified:

1. **Faulty Relay Confounds Learning**: When relay is faulty (ep001), both agents fail to identify correct layout
2. **Inconsistent Convergence**: Even without failures, agents sometimes converge to wrong layout with high confidence
3. **Example Problem (Actor ep004)**:
   - Ground truth: layout_A, no failure
   - Agent converged to: layout_B with 99% confidence
   - This is a **complete belief reversal** despite no mechanical issues

## 5. Query Type Performance Analysis

### Performance by Question Type (All Agents)

| Query Type      | Actor | Model-Based | Observer | Text-Reader |
|-----------------|-------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Interventional  | 0.746 | 0.705       | 0.656    | 0.689       |
| Counterfactual  | 0.500 | 0.433       | 0.400    | 0.367       |
| Planning        | 0.871 | 0.900       | 0.800    | 0.814       |

**Key Insights:**

1. **Planning questions are easiest** (80-90% across all agents)
   - These ask "what should we do" or "what would tell us X"
   - High-level strategic thinking

2. **Counterfactual reasoning is hardest** (36.7-50% across all agents)
   - Questions like "If we had done X instead of Y, what would have happened?"
   - Requires mentally simulating alternative timelines
   - **Major capability gap** - all agents struggle here

3. **Interventional questions are moderate** (65.6-74.6%)
   - Questions like "If we do X, what will happen?"
   - Forward prediction from current state

4. **Agent ranking consistency**:
   - Planning: Model-Based > Actor > Text-Reader > Observer
   - Interventional: Actor > Model-Based > Text-Reader > Observer
   - Counterfactual: Actor > Model-Based > Observer > Text-Reader

## 6. Surprisal Analysis

### Average Surprisal by Agent (excluding zeros)

| Agent        | Environment  | Mean Surprisal | Max Surprisal | Count |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Actor        | HotPotLab    | 3.647          | 9.339         | 25    |
| Actor        | SwitchLight  | 1.150          | 6.909         | 38    |
| Model-Based  | HotPotLab    | 3.187          | 9.405         | 34    |
| Model-Based  | SwitchLight  | 1.065          | 6.913         | 44    |
| Observer     | -            | -              | -             | 0     |
| Text-Reader  | -            | -              | -             | 0     |

**Findings:**

1. **Observer and Text-Reader have NO surprisal data**
   - They don't take actions, so they don't experience unexpected observations
   - Surprisal is only computed for active agents

2. **HotPotLab generates higher surprisal** (3.2-3.6) than SwitchLight (1.1-1.2)
   - HotPotLab has deceptive labels ("Boiling!" when pot is cold)
   - More counterintuitive dynamics

3. **Model-Based has slightly more surprisal events** (34 vs 25 in HotPotLab, 44 vs 38 in SwitchLight)
   - Suggests Model-Based makes more surprising observations
   - Could indicate more exploratory behavior

4. **Peak surprisal is similar** (~9.3-9.4 in HotPotLab, ~6.9 in SwitchLight)
   - Both agents hit same ceiling of "very unexpected" events

## 7. Common Error Patterns

### Actor Agent Top Errors

1. **HotPotLab Medium (46.7% accuracy)**:
   - Misjudging temperature evolution over time
   - Example: "If we wait 2 minutes without turning on stove, will touching burn us?" (scored 0.50)
   - Trusting labels too much despite contradictory measurements

2. **Counterfactual failures (50%)**:
   - "If we had turned stove to high and waited 1 minute, would we see >100°C?" (scored 0.50)
   - Struggles to rewind and simulate alternative action sequences

### Model-Based Agent Top Errors

1. **SwitchLight belief state errors**:
   - "If we flip switch to ON, will light definitely turn on?" - often wrong because agent didn't properly account for faulty relay
   - Overconfidence in incorrect layouts

2. **Inspection decision errors (50%)**:
   - "Should we pay for an inspection to see the wiring?"
   - Agents often say "no" when inspection would be valuable given uncertainty

### Observer Agent Top Errors

1. **Causal understanding without action**:
   - "What's the most likely explanation for light OFF with switch ON?" (0.0 score)
   - Can't build accurate causal models from description alone

2. **Safety reasoning**:
   - "What is safest way to determine if pot is hot?" (0.0 score)
   - Without hands-on experience, struggles with practical safety considerations

### Text-Reader Agent Top Errors

Similar pattern to Observer - struggles with:
1. Causal inference from text alone
2. Counterfactual reasoning (36.7%, worst of all agents)
3. Intervention planning without action experience

## 8. Hypothesis Testing Results

### H1: Observer vs. Actor (Observation-Only vs. Active Interaction)

**Result**: ❌ **CONTRADICTED**

- **Expected**: Observer should perform comparably to Actor
- **Actual**: Actor outperforms Observer by **12.7%** (75.3% vs 66.8%)
- **Environment breakdown**:
  - HotPotLab: Actor +20.6% better (82.0% vs 68.0%)
  - SwitchLight: Actor +4.6% better (68.6% vs 65.6%)

**Conclusion**: Active interaction provides substantial advantage, especially in physically interactive environments (HotPotLab).

### H2: Text-Reader vs. Observer (Text vs. Structured Observation)

**Result**: ✅ **PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**

- Text-Reader: 68.4%
- Observer: 66.8%
- Difference: +2.4% for Text-Reader (small but consistent)

**Interpretation**: Minimal difference suggests observation modality (text vs structured) matters less than ability to interact.

### H3: Model-Based vs. Actor (Explicit World Model vs. Implicit)

**Result**: ~ **NEUTRAL**

- Model-Based: 73.2%
- Actor: 75.3%
- Difference: -2.8% for Model-Based

**Interpretation**:
- Small difference suggests both approaches are roughly equivalent
- Model-Based slightly worse, possibly due to:
  - Overhead of maintaining explicit model
  - Errors in model structure
  - Similar internal representations despite different architectures

### H4: Surprisal Tracking Effectiveness

**Result**: ❌ **PROBLEMATIC**

- Only Actor and Model-Based generate surprisal (they take actions)
- High surprisal events correlate with belief updates
- **However**: Belief convergence accuracy is poor (40-60% in SwitchLight)

**Issues**:
- Surprisal is computed but may not be properly utilized for learning
- High surprisal doesn't reliably lead to correct belief updates
- Example: Actor ep001 has high surprisal (6.9) but converges to wrong layout (2% confidence in correct layout)

### H5: Counterfactual Reasoning Ability

**Result**: ❌ **MAJOR FAILURE ACROSS ALL AGENTS**

| Agent        | Counterfactual Score |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Actor        | 50.0%               |
| Model-Based  | 43.3%               |
| Observer     | 40.0%               |
| Text-Reader  | 36.7%               |

**All agents struggle with counterfactuals** - barely better than chance. This represents a fundamental limitation in current approach.

## 9. Critical Issues & Recommendations

### Issue 1: Belief State Convergence Failures (SwitchLight)

**Problem**: Agents converge to wrong layouts with high confidence

**Example**:
- Actor ep004: Ground truth = layout_A, Agent final belief = 99% layout_B
- This is a **complete reversal** with no mechanical excuse (relay not faulty)

**Possible Causes**:
1. Insufficient exploration (only 10 actions)
2. Bayesian update logic errors
3. Confirmation bias in belief updates
4. Initial priors not properly calibrated

**Recommendation**:
- Increase action budget to 15-20 for SwitchLight
- Add explicit "epistemic uncertainty" tracking
- Audit Bayesian update calculations for correctness
- Consider adding "restart from scratch" mechanism when belief becomes too confident

### Issue 2: Medium Difficulty Questions Paradox (HotPotLab)

**Problem**: Medium questions (30-47%) harder than hard questions (86.7-93.3%)

**Likely Cause**: Question labeling error or mismatch between difficulty and actual complexity

**Recommendation**:
- Review difficulty labels for HotPotLab questions
- Medium questions may involve temporal reasoning (heating over time) which is legitimately harder
- Consider separate difficulty axis for "temporal extrapolation"

### Issue 3: Counterfactual Reasoning Ceiling (36.7-50%)

**Problem**: No agent exceeds 50% on counterfactual questions

**Underlying Issue**: Current prompting/architecture doesn't support counterfactual simulation well

**Recommendations**:
1. **Explicit counterfactual prompting**: Add "imagine alternative timeline" scaffolding
2. **Mental simulation training**: Add examples of counterfactual reasoning to prompts
3. **Causal graph extraction**: Explicitly build causal DAG, then simulate interventions
4. **Contrastive learning**: Train on pairs of (factual, counterfactual) scenarios

### Issue 4: Token Efficiency vs. Performance Trade-off

**Observation**:
- Observer/Text-Reader: 6.3K tokens, 66.8-68.4% accuracy
- Actor/Model-Based: 22K tokens, 73.2-75.3% accuracy
- **Cost per percentage point**: ~230 tokens for active agents

**Question**: Is 8-12% improvement worth 3.5x token cost?

**Recommendation**:
- For cost-sensitive applications: Use Observer/Text-Reader
- For accuracy-critical applications: Use Actor
- Consider **hybrid approach**: Start with Observer, escalate to Actor if confidence low

## 10. Statistical Summary

### Overall Dataset Statistics

- **Total Episodes**: 40
- **Total Test Questions**: 400 (10 per episode)
- **Total API Calls**: 820
- **Total Tokens Consumed**: ~540K (13.5K avg per episode)
- **Total Duration**: ~132 minutes (3.3 min avg per episode)

### Confidence Calibration

| Agent        | Avg Confidence | Avg Accuracy | Calibration Gap |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Actor        | 0.839         | 0.753        | -0.086          |
| Model-Based  | 0.826         | 0.732        | -0.094          |
| Observer     | 0.820         | 0.668        | -0.152          |
| Text-Reader  | 0.658         | 0.684        | +0.026          |

**Findings**:
- **Overconfidence**: Actor, Model-Based, Observer report higher confidence than warranted
- **Well-calibrated**: Text-Reader is actually slightly underconfident (+2.6%)
- **Worst calibration**: Observer (-15.2% gap) - very confident but often wrong

---

## 11. Conclusions & Next Steps

### Main Conclusions

1. **Active interaction matters**: Actor agents show clear 8-12% advantage over passive observers
2. **Model-based vs implicit is neutral**: No clear winner between explicit world models and implicit learning
3. **Counterfactual reasoning is fundamentally limited**: All agents ~40-50%, major capability gap
4. **Belief convergence is unreliable**: Only 40-60% success rate in identifying correct causal structure
5. **Token efficiency gap is dramatic**: Passive agents 70% cheaper but 8-12% worse

### Recommended Next Steps

#### For Immediate Improvements:
1. **Fix belief state updates** - audit Bayesian calculations
2. **Increase action budget** to 15-20 for SwitchLight
3. **Add counterfactual scaffolding** to prompts
4. **Re-label medium difficulty questions** in HotPotLab

#### For Future Research:
1. **Hybrid agent architecture**: Combine Observer (cheap initial analysis) + Actor (targeted exploration)
2. **Causal discovery algorithms**: Use formal methods (PC algorithm, etc.) instead of informal Bayesian updates
3. **Meta-learning across episodes**: Allow agents to improve from episode to episode
4. **Richer environments**: Test on more complex causal structures (3+ variables, cycles, etc.)

#### For Hypothesis Validation:
1. **Expand sample size**: 5 episodes per condition may be too few for reliable conclusions
2. **Control for environment complexity**: Some findings may be environment-specific
3. **Add ablation studies**: Test individual components (surprisal tracking, prior generation, etc.)
