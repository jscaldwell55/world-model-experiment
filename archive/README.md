# Archive Directory

This directory contains internal development artifacts that are not needed for understanding or reproducing the main study results.

## Contents

### `docs/`
Internal development documentation, bug reports, and implementation notes created during the development process. These provide context about how the system evolved but are not necessary for understanding the final study.

### `analysis/`
Analysis scripts and diagnostic tools used during pilot studies and debugging. The main study analysis is available in the root directory (`analyze_full_study.py`).

### `configs/`
Old configuration files from pilot studies and testing. The final study configuration is `config_full_study_3agents.yaml` in the root directory.

## Note

These files are preserved for provenance and reproducibility but are not required reading for understanding the preregistered confirmatory study or its results.
